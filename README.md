### GitHub: Music Player Repository
- Big Greeen Buttons
- GitHub: create a repository and include ```github.io```
- Settings / Pages / Branch / ```None``` to ```Main``` / Press ```SAVE```
- Introduce computer instructions (must scan the screen for specific words with implied "click")
- Settings / Pages / Will see Webpage URL (not local)
- Copy HTML5 Files
- Must save file / refresh locally to see changes immediately
- Eventually GitHub Hosting will catch-up in the background
- Folder Organizattion
    - [ ] Images
    - [ ] Videos | Readme.txt with links 

### Copy these files into your Music Player Repository
- Double Click on the index.html to render locally for immediate changes
- Global rendering requires a hosted website (see Music Player Repository)

### Preview the index.html for
- WHITE Text & Changes
- What a DIV means & What a changing WINDOW Size (viewport in HTML5) means
  - Borrow idea of changing Window size
  - Borrow idea of DIVs

### Demonstrate how computers communicate (must know vocabulary)
- NOTE: must know vocabulary below
- CDM / tracert [website.domain] | cisco.com
- IPv4 is DNS, what a computer uses
- Use Google to identify pieces of server name
   - for example gettyimages.ca | server-3-164-255-63.yyc51.r.cloudfront.net | 3.164.255.63 | yyc is Calgary in Airport Letters
- Try Paired Programming and in a pair identifying the pieces of a server to ID location

### Complete first draft of music player & upload to GitHub Music Player Repository
- Case Study | AI Digital Drawing Wire Frame | Paper & Pencil digitalized and included in index.html
- GitHub & Internal Editting or Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Submit GitHub URL through Google FORM (parent pathway)

### Checklist for Case Study of Music Player | Wire Frame (Need Ratios for GUI)
- What Does the Overall Layout look like
- Where are the buttons and what do they look like (symbolic differences between buttons in 2D shapes)
- Must list all the buttons and what they do, unique behaviours (be specific using other players like Spotify Behaviours)
  - NOTE: Algorithm to change presentation of button on Hoverover & click
  - Quit
  - Play
  - Pause
  - Stop
  - Fast Forward
  - Fast Reverse
  - Mute
  - Loop-Once
  - Loop-infinite
  - Shuffle
  - Next
  - Previous
- Where are the images (Algorithm: Introduction to Aspect Ratio)
- What is the text and where is it (Algorithm: feedback to user)
  - Position of Song
  - Time Remaining
  - Song Title
  - Advanced: ```Try``` Additional Items ( right click on mp3 / details ) ```Catch``` Null
- What are the colours, day mode, dark mode, and night mode ( global design algorithms )

- NOTE: able to transfer images using students Google Photos

- Advanced: autoplay changes all above buttons
- Intermediate and Advanced CS Classes must do this part
- Introductory should consider it

### Personalizing the ```index.html``` File
- Change the HTML File to represent the Music Player Case Study | Wireframe
- Introducotry: site.css & script.js optional
- Intermediate: HTML in Flexbox, see https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp
- Intermediate: JavaScript DOM, see https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp

### Case Study of Music Player | Wire Frame (Need Ratios for GUI)

- What Does the Overall Layout look like
- Where are the buttons and what do they look like (symbolic differences between buttons in 2D shapes)
- Where are the images (Introduction to Aspect Ratio)
- What is the text and where is it (feedback to user)
- What are the colours, day mode, dark mode, and night mode
- What are the DIV Ratios (might need to do 2D Shapes first)

- NOTE: Use images and Google Images to transfer to students

- NOTE: Music Player Functions are also required
     - Must work these out with functions
     - Given basic functions available ... List these for Paper and Pencil Activity, what a computer uses to think 
     - Then mimic an end-user perspective
- Then, add conditionals for catches (Intermediate)
- Then, add autoplay


### Collecting Information, Text & Links of HTML

- Start content collection for music player
- Introduce ideas of developer and influences | HTML Porfolio, simple changes
- Introduce idea of YouTube Videos & APIs (not just the URL) | All Videos, associated with music files | theme
- All Images to be used in music player, associated with music files | theme
- Text explaination or description to go with each photo or image

### Reading through HTML5 
- HTML: using <!-- comments -->
- Will indent blockquote sections 
- Semantic Tags
- Other Tags
- Finding more tages

Add these tags to the HTML 
- Imges & Videos: <figure></figure> & <figcaption></figcaption>
- Who is the creator, with hyperlink: <cite a=""></cite>

Note:
- Notepad or Notepad++ will work
- Using Chrome to point to Q: will work
- / \ are used differently
- https/80 & https/443 are called sockets (the basics of hacking and cybersecurity)
- Search Javascript in Chrome / Settings to see if Javascript can be turned off

# Notes: concurrent activities to deal with tech issues, etc.
- Create hosted repository
- Create Folder Strucutre
- Copy index.html, site.css, .js
- Collect information for HTML Based on Case Study of Music Player
- HTML
     - Theme of Player: name, description, image, colours that will be used
     - Text: player | related to individual music files
     - Music 
     - Image Links about music
